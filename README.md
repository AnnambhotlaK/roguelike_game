# Roguelike Game

## Description
This game is a project of personal interest in video game development. I relied on the "Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial" guide in order to create this game, which extensively utilizes Python and the TCOD library. The game features a dungeon-crawling protagonist who battles various foes through endless floors. On each floor, players are put in a procedurally-generated map and must equip gear, use spells, and upgrade their character in order to progress. The game features a compartmentalized user interface, as well as a "save-upon-close" system so players may enjoy the game in small bursts.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Running this game requires Python 3.7 or higher and the TCOD library to be installed. (**Note: Python 2 is not compatible with this game.**)

### Installation
* All of the code may be accessed within this repository.

### Executing Program
This program runs best within a virtual environment. The game will launch upon running the `main.py` file.
